## Overview
This is my first React app. it was bootstraped with create react app. I have started learning react via this tutorial;

I decided it would be best to start with a newbie project and work my way back up. Coonsidering it is very basic it wasn't very difficult but I am begining to get React's basic concepts. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
